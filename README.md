# LookUp

Many people find it difficult to keep track of astronomical events and identify stars or planets when stargazing. This often results in missed opportunities to experience the wonders of the night sky, especially for amateur astronomers and curious minds. "Look Up” is an app that solves this problem by offering a personalized stargazing experience with real-time star maps and event notifications. Whether you’re a city dweller curious about the stars or a traveler looking for guidance under clear skies, "Look Up” makes the cosmos accessible, engaging, and easy to explore.

We are intending to use the Firestore Firebase as a cloud database, and its authentication, calendar, and analytics services to build our app. The authentication service will manage user login and profiles, and will store user data in real-time, allowing users to save their star collections. We will also use the cloud messaging service to send personalized notifications for upcoming events and daily facts. The analytics service will track user behavior to help us optimize the app’s performance. Finally, we will also use cloud storage to host media like live videos of the Earth, Moon, and any other astronomical object. 

Our app would use Google authentication to allow users to log into their accounts securely. It would allow them to create personal accounts where they can track their quiz scores and compete against other users. Moreover, each time they observe a new star, planet, or constellation, they can upload it to their profile and work on completing collections of things to observe, like a "checklist."

Our idea revolves around using multiple sensors: the GPS, gyroscope, and camera, which will enable the user to view an accurate location-based star map by pointing their phone at the sky. They will experience augmented reality, overlaying the star map with real-time camera footage of the sky. And finally, receive real-time recommendations for stargazing based on their current location. 

In offline mode, users will experience an intuitive interface where they can easily access pre-loaded astronomy quizzes and a calendar of upcoming celestial events. A simple toggle or notification will inform them that they're offline, but essential content remains available. Features will include progress tracking and event reminders, which will sync once the user reconnects to the internet.
